		If the given child is a reference to an existing node in the document, appendChild() moves it from its current position to the new position — there is no requirement to remove the node from its parent node before appending it to some other node. This means that a node can't be in two points of the document simultaneously. The Node.cloneNode() method can be used to make a copy of the node before appending it under the new parent. Copies made with cloneNode are not automatically kept in sync.
